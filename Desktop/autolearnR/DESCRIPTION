Description: Provides automated diagnostic checks for datasets, including
    detection of variable types, class balance, normality, missing values,
    and zero-variance features. Based on these diagnostics, the package
    suggests appropriate machine learning models for classification,
    regression, or clustering tasks. Designed for simplicity and reproducibility.
